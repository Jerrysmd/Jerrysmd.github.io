Let’s first define vector embedding. Vector embedding is a type of data representation that carries semantic information that helps AI systems get a better understanding of the data as well as being able to maintain long-term memory. With anything new you’re trying to learn, the important elements are understanding the topic and remembering it. Embeddings are generated by AI models, such as LLMs which contain a large number of features that makes their representation difficult to manage. Embedding represents the different dimensions of the data, to help AI models understand different relationships, patterns, and hidden structures. Vector embedding using traditional scalar-based databases is a challenge, as it cannot handle or keep up with the scale and complexity of the data. With all the complexity that comes with vector embedding, you can imagine the specialized database it requires. This is where vector databases come into play. Vector databases offer optimized storage and query capabilities for the unique structure of vector embeddings. They provide easy search, high performance, scalability, and data retrieval all by comparing values and finding similarities between one another. That sounds great, right? There’s a solution to dealing with the complex structure of vector embeddings. Yes, but no. Vector databases are very difficult to implement. Until now, vector databases were only used by tech giants that had the capabilities to not only develop them but also be able to manage them. Vector databases are expensive, therefore ensuring that they are properly calibrated is important to provide high performance.

So now we know a little bit about vector embeddings and databases, let’s go into how it works. Let’s start with a simple example of dealing with an LLM such as ChatGPT. The model has large volumes of data with a lot of content, and they provide us with the ChatGPT application. So let’s go through the steps. As the user, you will input your query into the application. Your query is then inserted into the embedding model which creates vector embeddings based on the content we want to index. The vector embedding then moves into the vector database, regarding the content that the embedding was made from. The vector database produces an output and sends it back to the user as a query result. When the user continues to make queries, it will go through the same embedding model to create embeddings to query that database for similar vector embeddings. The similarities between the vector embeddings are based on the original content, in which the embedding was created. Want to know more about how it works in the vector database? Let’s learn more. Traditional databases work with storing strings, numbers, etc in rows and columns. When querying from traditional databases, we are querying for rows that match our query. However, vector databases work with vectors rather than strings, etc. Vector databases also apply a similarity metric which is used to help find a vector most similar to the query. A vector database is made up of different algorithms which all aid in the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. This is done via hashing, graph-based search, or quantization which are assembled into a pipeline to retrieve neighbors of a queried vector. The results are based on how close or approximate it is to the query, therefore the main elements that are considered are accuracy and speed. If the query output is slow, the more accurate the result. The three main stages that a vector database query goes through are: 1. Indexing As explained in the example above, once the vector embedding moves into the vector database, it then uses a variety of algorithms to map the vector embedding to data structures for faster searching. 2. Querying Once it has gone through its search, the vector database compares the queried vector to indexed vectors, applying the similarity metric to find the nearest neighbor. 3. Post Processing Depending on the vector database you use, the vector database will post-process the final nearest neighbor to produce a final output to the query. As well as possibly re-ranking the nearest neighbors for future reference.

The comparison table paints a clear picture, but here’s a succinct summary to aid your decision: Open-Source and hosted cloud: If you lean towards open-source solutions, Weviate, Milvus, and Chroma emerge as top contenders. Pinecone, although not open-source, shines with its developer experience and a robust fully hosted solution. Performance: When it comes to raw performance in queries per second, Milvus takes the lead, closely followed by Weviate and Qdrant. However, in terms of latency, Pinecone and Milvus both offer impressive sub-2ms results. If nmultiple pods are added for pinecone, then much higher QPS can be reached. Community Strength: Milvus boasts the largest community presence, followed by Weviate and Elasticsearch. A strong community often translates to better support, enhancements, and bug fixes. Scalability, advanced features and security: Role-based access control, a feature crucial for many enterprise applications, is found in Pinecone, Milvus, and Elasticsearch. On the scaling front, dynamic segment placement is offered by Milvus and Chroma, making them suitable for ever-evolving datasets. If you’re in need of a database with a wide array of index types, Milvus’ support for 11 different types is unmatched. While hybrid search is well-supported across the board, Elasticsearch does fall short in terms of disk index support. Pricing: For startups or projects on a budget, Qdrant’s estimated $9 pricing for 50k vectors is hard to beat. On the other end of the spectrum, for larger projects requiring high performance, Pinecone and Milvus offer competitive pricing tiers. In conclusion, there’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to vector databases. The ideal choice varies based on specific project needs, budget constraints, and personal preferences. This guide offers a comprehensive lens to view the top vector databases of 2023, hoping to simplify the decision-making process for developers. My choice? I’m testing out Pinecone and Milvus in the wild, mostly because of their high performance, Milvus strong community and price flexibility at scale.

For example, we can configure a security context to display an authentication button in Swagger UI: @Configuration @EnableSwagger2 public class SwaggerConfig { @Bean public Docket api() { return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2) .select() .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage(\"com.example.demo.controller\")) .paths(PathSelectors.any()) .build() .securitySchemes(Arrays.asList( new ApiKey(\"Bearer\", \"Authorization\", \"header\") )) .securityContexts(Collections.singletonList( SecurityContext.builder() .securityReferences(Collections.singletonList( new SecurityReference(\"Bearer\", new AuthorizationScope[0]) )) .build() )) .apiInfo(apiInfo()); } private ApiInfo apiInfo() { return new ApiInfoBuilder() .title(\"API Documentation\") .description(\"API Documentation\") .version(\"1.0.0\") .build(); } } In the above code, we use the securityContexts() method to configure a security context to display an authentication button in Swagger UI. Ignoring Parameters In some cases, certain parameters in an interface may contain sensitive information that we don’t want to display in the API documentation. We can use the @ApiIgnore annotation to ignore these parameters. For example, we can use the @ApiIgnore annotation on the password parameter in the User class to ignore it: @ApiModel(description = \"User information\") public class User { @ApiModelProperty(value = \"User ID\", example = \"1\") private Long id; @ApiModelProperty(value = \"Username\", example = \"John Doe\") private String username; @ApiModelProperty(hidden = true) @ApiIgnore private String password; // Getter and setter methods omitted } In the above code, @ApiModelProperty(hidden = true) indicates that the parameter is hidden, and @ApiIgnore indicates that the parameter should be ignored.

When using Swagger, it’s important to keep the following points in mind: Use annotations to describe API information, including API names, request methods, request paths, request parameters, response parameters, etc. Configure Swagger in the configuration class, including the package paths to scan, API documentation information, global parameters, security schemes, security contexts, etc. Describe data models, enums, response parameters, and other information to help developers understand the functionality and parameters of the API. Use the @ApiIgnore annotation to exclude sensitive parameters from being displayed. Finally, it’s important to note that Swagger is just a specification and toolset. It cannot replace other testing methods such as unit testing and integration testing. During the development process, it’s necessary to use a combination of testing approaches to ensure the quality and stability of the software.

The use of these instruments requires firms to make key decisions based on their specific needs Risk Limits: Limit Nature Example Weakness Stop Loss Limits 止损点 Loss threshold and associated action (e.g. close out, escalation) Will not prevent future exposure, only limit realized losses. Notional Limits 本金上限 Notional size of exposure Notional amount may not be strongly related to economic risk of derivative instruments, especially options Risk Specific Limits 风险指标 Limits referencing some special feature of risk in question (e.g. liquidity ratios（流动性比例） for liquidity risk) These limits are difficult to aggregate; may require specialized knowledge to interpret. Maturity/Gap Limits 期限/缺口限制 Limit amount of transactions that mature or reset/ reprice in each time period These limits reduce the risk that a large volume of transactions will need to be dealt with in a given time frame,with all the operational and liquidity risks this can bring. But they do not speak directly to price risk. Concentration Limits 集中度限制 Limits of concentrations of various kinds(e.g.,to individual counterparties,or product type) These limits must be set with the understanding of correlation risks. They may not capture correlation risks in stressed markets. Greek Limits 特殊限制 《估值与风险建模》 Option positions need to be limited in terms of their unique risk characteristics (e.g.,delta,gamma, vega risk These limits suffer from all the classic model risks and calculation may be compromised at trading desk level without the right controls and independence VaR Aggregate statistical number VaR suffers from all the classic model risks and may be misinterpreted by senior management.

Stress tests look at specific stresses. Sensitivity tests look at the sensitivity of a position or portfolio to changes in key variables. Scenario modeling looks at given real-world scenarios(hypothetical or historical). Varies in sophistication. Dependent on deep knowledge of the firm’s exposures and market behavior.

The asset may be delivered physically, or the contract may stipulate a cash settlement (i.e.,the difference between the agreed upon price and some specified spot or current price) Futures 从 Forward 衍生出来的一种标准化合约 It is an exchange-listed forward with standardized terms, subject to margining. Swap 从 Forward 衍生出来的一系列远期 It is an over-the-counter(OTC) agreement to swap the cash flows(or value) associated with two different economic positions until(or at) the maturity of the contract. For example,one side to an interest rate swap might agree to pay a fixed interest rate on an agreed upon notional amount for an agreed upon period,while the other agrees to pay the variable rate. Swaps take different forms depending on the underlying market. Call OptionOption 叫做期权，是一种买卖的权利 看涨 The purchaser of a call option has the right, but not the obligation,to buy the underlying asset at an agreed upon strike price,either at the maturity date(European option) or at any point during an agreed upon period(American option). Put Option看跌 The purchaser of a put option has the right,but not the obligation,to self the underlying asset at the agreed upon strike price at the maturity date(European option) or at any point during an agreed upon period(American option). Exotic Option歧义 There are many different options beyond the standard or plain vanilla puts and calls. These include Asian (or average price) options and basket options(based on a basket of prices).

One can note, however, that failed bank Northern Rock had several banking experts on its board. Board Risk Oversight The importance of boards being proactive in risk oversight became increasingly recognized following the crisis.（事必躬亲） Risk Appetite Regulators have pushed banks to articulate a formal, board-approved risk appetite that defines a firm’s willingness to undertake risk and tolerate threats to solvency. This can be translated into an enterprise- wide setting of risk limits. Compensation One of a board’s key levers in determining risk behavior is its control over compensation（股权激励） schemes. Boards have a duty to examine how pay structures might affect risk-taking and whether risk- adjustment mechanisms capture all key long-term risks.

How is risk management delegated through the organization? What roles do the executive staff and board committees undertake in the execution and oversight of risk management? How does risk management policy filter down to business managers and how is it reflected in the way regular business is conducted? 1. Best Practice of Corporate Governance The board should Look after the interests of shareholders (gatekeeper) Be responsible for the concerns of other stakeholders (debtholders and employees). Oversee executive management and alert for any conflict of interests between the management and stakeholders (agency problems) Clawback(要回分红) provisions Separate the role of the CEO and the chairman of the board Comprise a majority of independent members Consider introducing a CRO The board plays a central role in risk management, especially in shaping and overseeing risk Decide appropriate risk appetite Assess firm’s risk management systems and procedures Strive for economic performance(对应 operation risk) not accounting performance(对应 financial risk) Ensure major transactions are consistent with the risk authorized Keep the disclosure adequate and transparent Balance the risk and rewards Take the ultimate responsibility Be trained on risk issues Establish and maintain CRO Maintain the independence of audit committee 2. Corporate Governance at Board Level The board often delegates its power to some professional committees to implement risk appetite and break it down into a set of practical restrictions and limitations. Risk Management Committee(风险管理委员会，属于 Board) Set risk appetite on annual basis Translate the overall risk appetite into a set of limits Approve and independently review risk levels Report back to the board on a variety of items, such as all loans and credits over a specified dollar limit. Risk Advisory Director （RAD，属于 Board）: is a member of the board who specializes in risk matters. Compensation Committee Determine the compensation of top executives . Be aligned with the long-term interests of stakeholders, and with risk-adjusted return on capital Removal of guaranteed bonuses Stock-based compensation can encourage risk-taking Audit Committee of The Board Independently verify whether the firm is doing what it claims to be doing Check for discrepancies and infringements in regulatory, legal compliance, and risk management activities. Assess the quality of reporting, compliance, internal control, and risk management processes. Audit committee members are required to be knowledgeable, capable of independent judgement, financially literate, and have the utmost integrity. 3. Corporate Governance at Management Level The Role of the CRO The CRO is usually a member of the risk committee and is responsible for the design of the firm’s risk management program The CRO is also responsible for risk policies, analysis approaches, and methodologies,as well as the risk management infrastructure and governance inside the organization. The bank’s senior risk committee delegates the power(分权) to make day-to day decisions to the CRO CRO should also report directly to the CEO, maintain a seat on the board risk committee, and have a voice in approving new financial instruments and lines of business. At many banks,CROs act as a liaison between the board and management. 4. Risk Appetite filters down Risk appetite and business strategy There needs to be an iterative relationship between setting risk - appetite and implementing business strategy Iteration starts with a concept of risk appetite -\u003e implementing business strategy -\u003e aggregation -\u003e checking back with the risk appetite framework -\u003e adjusting as necessary (先有 risk appetite, 然后一步一步往下级调整, 调整比较困难) There are always challenges to strike balance between business 1 opportunity and risk limits Fail to exercise the right amount of flexibility Too restrictive: policemen （CRO ） Too flexible: potential of large loss It is now widely recognized that compensation is part of a sound risk culture.

Represents the return that investors and savers need to convince them to willingly lend their money. Typically associated with a specific investment. Example: If I deposit my money in a bank, what would the interest rate be? In this case: Interest rate = Required Rate of Return = Real Risk-free Return (真实无风险收益率) + Inflation Rate (通货膨胀收益率) Breaking down the required rate of return: Nominal risk-free rate = real risk-free rate + expected inflation rate. Required interest rate on a security = nominal risk-free rate + default risk premium + liquidity risk premium + maturity risk premium. Discount Rate Discount rate / 折现率 This is the interest rate used to discount future payments. It is often used interchangeably with the term “interest rate”. Depending on the situation, “interest rate” can have different names: Example 1: I deposit $100 in a bank for one year and receive a 10% interest rate. After one year, I have 110. In this scenario, the 10% interest rate is referred to as the 10% Required Rate of Return. Example 2: I want to have $10 after one year. If the interest rate is 10%, how much should I deposit in the bank? Using the formula (x+10)/(1+10%) = x, we find x = 100. In this scenario, the 10% interest rate is referred to as the 10% Discount Rate. Opportunity Cost Opportunity cost / 机会成本 This can be seen as a type of interest rate.

受行为主义和精神分析的启发，商家们希望能找到人们无意识状态下做出选择的秘密，也就是人类认知的隐藏源泉。 伯内斯在纽约一年一度的复活节假期游行期间组织了一场“伪活动”。他邀请了十几位女权主义者一边抽着香烟一边参加游行，并把香烟称为“自由的火炬”。第二天，这个女权主义事件便出现在媒体上并引起很大的反响 女权主义者早在爱德华·伯内斯的营销事件之前，就早已把香烟作为解放女性和反对旧时代女性标准的象征了。 成功的广告公司可以操纵人类的动机和欲望，甚至让公众对那些他们不了解，也不想买的商品产生欲望。 迪希特经常把精神分析和符号学混合在一起，而且喜欢用神奇的性解释一切：吸烟就像口交，能带给人快感；芦笋长得像阴茎，因此具有性意义；对女性来说，烹饪就是一种生育仪式；木头具有感官美感，树木的纹理会唤起兴奋并吸引爱抚…… 对于消费者直接可获得的消费品而言，广告的影响就更加不稳定了。一名美国公民可能会相信国家对于俄罗斯的描述和宣传，因为他永远也不会真正接触到俄罗斯，俄罗斯对他来说是一个遥远而抽象的存在，可以受媒体图像摆布。但日常触手可及的番茄酱就不一样了，人们随时可以在商店买到、随时可以尝试，因此就不会随便听信广告对于它的宣传了。

由于人们的劳动地点从社群转移到市场，家庭也越来越少地参与社群的集体活动了，现代家庭的模式逐渐形成，它的规模逐渐变小，成为仅由父母和子女组成的紧密核心，大家逐渐习惯了“各自在家，各自为己”的生活方式。这意味着个人隐私、亲密关系和自我实现的意义被重视起来了。

然而，随着工业化和有薪就业的推进，雇佣的、外部的、男性工作与家庭的、内部的、女性工作之间产生了区隔。当男人远离家乡，到工厂和商业空间从事生产劳作、带来收入时，妇女却在花钱，尽管这是为维持家庭正常运行必要的开支。女人不再是生产者，而是成为负责家庭采购的“自雇者”。男人与女人的劳动空间彼此隔离，导致他们的经济地位和思想观念也发生了极大变化，这一切“破坏了婚姻中的两性平等，使女性成为仆人般的角色”[插图]。尽管女人和以前一样，完成着家中的劳作，但现在她们的地位却大不如前，毕竟，人们会认为花钱的人不如挣钱的人重要。 这些工具减少了家务劳动的时间，让妇女有更多时间照顾孩子和休闲。家庭劳动变得更加工业化了，这虽然增加了家庭生活成本，但极大地改变了家务所需的时间，以及家务工作的构成。由于基础设施、材料和工具的进步，人们对清洁度和舒适度的标准和要求也越来越高。 商品崇拜、劳动分工和工资制度都是家庭内部生产关系解体的原因。 母亲虽然只属于小小的一家之地，但是她所负责的住宅却是现代人倾注大量注意力的地方——它正日益被重新思考和安排。 现代商品陷入了一种“根本妥协”，即购买特定商品才能提高家庭地位和声望。人们很多时候都是在被迫的状态下必须要买一些东西，很少是因为有用或因为喜欢才买。 近几十年来，家务工作的不平等分配已显著减少，但西方国家的女性花在家务上的时间仍然是男性的2-6倍。￼虽然男人可能更多地承担了与房屋维护（修理、园艺）有关的工作，室内清洁、做饭和洗衣这类的工作还是主要由女性承担。人们对家中母亲的固有观点仍然是希望她们做好家务、养好孩子，她们仍然要对家庭幸福负责。

This included gathering feedback from potential users, researching similar extensions on the market, and analyzing the technical requirements for implementing the desired functionality. Based on this analysis, we identified the following functional requirements for the extension: The extension should be able to identify and remove recommended, promoted, and advertisement Weibo from the timeline. The extension should allow the user to customize which types of Weibo they want to remove (e.g. recommended only, promoted only, both recommended and promoted). The extension should have a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily enable or disable the extension. In addition to these functional requirements, we also identified the following non-functional requirements: The extension should be lightweight and not significantly impact the performance of the browser. The extension should be compatible with the latest version of Google Chrome. The extension should be easy to install and use for the average user. By considering these requirements, we were able to create a clear vision for the extension and develop a plan for its development.

The interface will consist of a toggle button and a drop-down menu, both of which can be accessed from the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. Weibo identification: To identify recommended, promoted, and advertisement Weibo, the extension will use a combination of CSS selectors and JavaScript code. The selectors will be used to locate the relevant elements on the page, and the JavaScript code will be used to determine whether the elements should be removed based on the user’s preferences. Performance optimization: To ensure that the extension does not significantly impact the performance of the browser, we will optimize the code for efficiency and minimize the number of DOM manipulations. We will also implement caching and other performance-enhancing techniques as necessary. Overall, our design aims to create a simple and effective tool that improves the user’s experience on Weibo by removing unwanted content from the timeline.

的数据量较大，对于不存在 keyby 的 Flink 任务也会出现该情况。 解决方案：需要让 Flink 任务强制进行 shuffle。使用 shuffle、rebalance（reb的轮询比shuffle的随机更好，rescale是范围轮询） 或 rescale 算子即可将数据均匀分配，从而解决数据倾斜的问题。 keyBy 后发生数据倾斜 扩展 Hive、mr、spark 都有可能 keyby 数据倾斜的通用方法： 双重聚合，如 a 开头的数据有10万条，把 a 数据用 hash 打散，a_0 ~ a_9，每个数据 1 万条；第二次把后缀去掉，把 a 的十条数据再做一次累加得到结果。 Flink 直接聚合，不用开窗用不了。因为流处理还是一条条写数据，没有解决数据数量问题，下游去掉随机数重新 keyby 还是 a 数据还是到一起了，仍然有可能数据倾斜 + 重复数据问题导致结果不对，由于流处理，keyby 本身是 1+1+1+1，流处理变成了1+2+3+4。当然使用开窗可以规避，但开窗还会数据倾斜。 使用 LocalKeyBy 的思想：定义状态，积攒批次的处理。类似 MapReduce 中 Combiner 的思想。 在本地定义状态，使用定时器或者设置数量到达多少的时候，map 端的数据进行一个累加经过 keyby 再到 reduce 端。 keyBy 后的窗口聚合操作存在数据倾斜 窗口就是批处理，窗口只输出一次结果。 但是两个窗口也会出现 4+4 变成 4+8 的现象。（将多个窗口的数据放在一起）（第一个窗口 4 个 a，最终窗口keyby后输出 [a, 4]，第二个窗口又来 4 个 a，去掉随机数后由于都是 a，第二窗口的 [a, 4] 就会和第一个窗口的 [a, 4] sum 操作 变成 [a, 8]，第一个窗口和第二个窗口累加就会出现 [a, 12] 这个错误结果） 解决方法：带上窗口信息进行聚合。 实现思路： key 拼接随机数前缀或后缀，进行 keyby 、开窗、聚合； 注意： 聚合完不再是 windowedStream，要获取 windowEnd 作为窗口标记作为第二阶段分组依据，避免不同窗口的结果聚合到一起。 去掉随机数前缀或后缀，按照原来的 key 及 windowEnd 作为 keyby、聚合。 ","date":"2021-06-23","objectID":"/20210623_flink-optimize/:3:2","tags":["DataWarehouse","Tuning","Flink"],"title":"Flink Performance

Spark支持可插拔的集群管理模式(Standalone、Mesos以及YARN )，集群管理负责启动executor进程，编写Spark application 的人根本不需要知道Spark用的是什么集群管理。Spark支持的三种集群模式，这三种集群模式都由两个组件组成:master和slave。Master服务(YARN ResourceManager,Mesos master和Spark standalone master)决定哪些application可以运行，什么时候运行以及哪里去运行。而slave服务( YARN NodeManager, Mesos slave和Spark standalone slave)实际上运行executor进程。 当在YARN上运行Spark作业，每个Spark executor作为一个YARN容器(container)运行。Spark可以使得多个Tasks在同一个容器(container)里面运行。这是个很大的优点。 注意这里和Hadoop的MapReduce作业不一样，MapReduce作业为每个Task开启不同的JVM来运行。虽然说MapReduce可以通过参数来配置。详见mapreduce.job.jvm.numtasks 从广义上讲，yarn-cluster适用于生产环境；而yarn-client适用于交互和调试，也就是希望快速地看到application的输出。 Application Master。在YARN中，每个Application实例都有一个Application Master进程，它是Application启动的第一个容器。它负责和ResourceManager打交道，并请求资源。获取资源之后告诉NodeManager为其启动container。 从深层次的含义讲，yarn-cluster和yarn-client模式的区别其实就是Application Master进程的区别，yarn-cluster模式下，driver运行在AM(Application Master)中，它负责向YARN申请资源，并监督作业的运行状况。当用户提交了作业之后，就可以关掉Client，作业会继续在YARN上运行。然而yarn-cluster模式不适合运行交互类型的作业。而yarn-client模式下，Application Master仅仅向YARN请求executor，client会和请求的container通信来调度他们工作，也就是说Client不能离开。（上图是yarn-cluster模式，下图是yarn-client模式）： spark-yarn-f31 spark-yarn-f22 ","date":"2020-08-11","objectID":"/20200811_yarn-clusteryarn-client/:0:0","tags":["Spark","Yarn"],"title":"Spark On Yarn: yarn-cluster, yarn-client","uri":"/20200811_yarn-clusteryarn-client/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"Article description.","date":"2020-08-03","objectID":"/20200803_spark-guide3/","tags":["Java","Spark"],"title":"Spark: A Framework for Large-Scale Data Processing, Part Ⅲ","uri":"/20200803_spark-guide3/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"Apache Spark has its architectural foundation in the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.

生成的AST其实最终还没办法直接运行，这个AST是逻辑计划，结束后，需要生成物理计划，从而生成RDD来运行。 Dataset \u0026 DataFrame RDD 优点： JVM对象组成的分布式数据集合 不可变并且有容错能力 可处理机构化和非结构化的数据 支持函数式转换 RDD缺点： 没有Schema 用户自己优化程序 从不同的数据源读取数据非常困难 合并多个数据源中的数据也非常困难

DataFrame的缺点： 编译时不能类型转化安全检查，运行时才能确定是否有问题 对于对象支持不友好，rdd内部数据直接以java对象存储，dataframe内存存储的是row对象而不能是自定义对象 Dataset的优点： DateSet整合了RDD和DataFrame的优点，支持结构化和非结构化数据 和RDD一样，支持自定义对象存储 和DataFrame一样，支持结构化数据的sql查询

DataFrame是弱类型，Dataset是强类型。DataFrame的操作方式和Dataset是一样的，但是对于强类型的操作而言，他们处理的类型是不同的 DataFrame在进行强类型操作的时候，例如map算子，所处理的数据类型永远是Row 而Dataset，其中是什么类型，他就处理什么类型。 val df: DataFrame = personList.toDF() df.map( (row: Row) =\u003e Row(row.get(0), row,getAs[Int](1) * 2))(RowEncoder.apply(df.schema)) val ds: Dataset[person] = personList.toDS() ds.map((person: Person =\u003e Person(person.name, person.age * 2))) DataFrame只能做到运行时类型检查，Dataset能做到编译和运行都有类型检查 DataFrame弱类型是编译时不安全(df.groupBy(“name, school”)) Dataset所代表的操作，是类型安全的，编译时安全的(ds.filter(person =\u003e person.name)) Row DataFrame就是Row集合加上Schema信息 case class Person(name: String, age: Int) def row(): Unit = { //1.Row如何创建，是什么 //row对象必须配合Schema对象才会有列名 val person = Person(\"zs\", 15) val row = Row(\"zs\", 15) //2.如何从Row中获取数据 row.getString(0) row.getInt(1)

Parquet属于Hadoop生态圈的一种新型列式存储格式，既然属于Hadoop生态圈，因此也兼容大多圈内计算框架（Hadoop、Spark），另外Parquet是平台、语言无关的，这使得它的适用性很广，只要相关语言有对应支持的类库就可以用； Parquet的优劣对比： 支持嵌套结构，这点对比同样是列式存储的OCR具备一定优势； 适用于OLAP场景，对比CSV等行式存储结构，列示存储支持映射下推和谓词下推，减少磁盘IO； 同样的压缩方式下，列式存储因为每一列都是同构的，因此可以使用更高效的压缩方法； def parquet(): Unit = { //read val df = spark.read.option(\"header\", true).csv(\"dataset/bjPM.csv\") //把数据写为parquet格式 df.write .format(\"parquet\") .mode(Savemode.Overwrite) .save(\"dataset/bj_PM\") //读取Parquet格式文件 spark.read .load(\"dataset/bj_PM\") .show() } Partition 表分区的概念不仅在parquet上有，其他格式的文件也可以指定表分区 def parquetPartions(): Unit ={ val df = spark.read .option(\"header\",value = true) .csv(\"dataset/BJPM.csv\") //分区表形式写文件 df.write .partitionBy(\"year\", \"month\")

可以直接从RDD读取JSON的DataFrame，把RDD[JsonString]转为Dataset[Object] Hive 整合什么内容 MetaStore，元数据存储 SparkSql内置的有一个MetaStore。更成熟，功能更强，而且可以使用Hive的元信息 查询引擎 SparkSQL内置了HiveSQL的支持 Hive的MetaStore Hive的MetaStore是Hive的一个组件。Hive中主要的组件组件就三个： HiveServer2负责接收外部系统的查询请求，列如JDBC，HiveServer2接收查询请求后，交给Driver处理 Driver会首先询问MetaStore表在哪存，后Driver程序通过MR程序来访问HDFS从而获取结果返回给查询请求者 MetaStore对SparkSQL的意义重大，如果SparkSQL可以直接访问Hive的MetaStore，则理论上可以做和Hive一样的事情，例如通过Hive表查询数据 而Hive的MetaStore的运行模式有三种： 内嵌Derby数据库模式 单链接，不支持并发 local模式 local和remote都是访问MySQL数据库作为存储元数据的地方，但是local模式的MetaStore没有独立进程，依附于HiveServer2的进程 Remote模式 和Local模式一样，访问MySQL数据库存放元数据，但是Remote的MetaStore运行在独立的进程中 Hive开启MetaStore 修改hive-sito.xml 启动Hive MetaStore nohup /export/servers/hive/bin/hive –service metastore 2\u003e\u00261 » /var/log.log \u0026 SparkSQL整合Hive的MetaStore 即使不去整合MetaStore，spark也有一个内置的MetaStore，使用Derby数据库保存数据，但这种方式不适合生产环境。 通过SparkSQL查询Hive的表 查询hive找那个的表可以通过spark。sql()来进行，可以直接在其中访问hive的MetaStore，","date":"2020-07-07","objectID":"/20200707_spark-guide2/:2:0","tags":["Java","Spark"],"title":"Spark: A Framework for Large-Scale Data

默认格式，存储方式为行存储，数据不做压缩，磁盘开销大，数据解析开销大。可结合Gzip、Bzip2使用(系统自动检查，执行查询时自动解压)，但使用这种方式，压缩后的文件不支持split，Hive不会对数据进行切分，从而无法对数据进行并行操作。并且在反序列化过程中，必须逐个字符判断是不是分隔符和行结束符，因此反序列化开销会比SequenceFile高几十倍。 2、SequenceFile SequenceFile是HadoopAPI提供的一种二进制文件支持，存储方式为行存储，其具有使用方便、可分割、可压缩的特点。 SequenceFile支持三种压缩选择：NONE，RECORD，BLOCK。Record压缩率低，一般建议使用BLOCK压缩。 优势是文件和hadoopapi中的MapFile是相互兼容的 3、RCFile 存储方式：数据按行分块，每块按列存储。结合了行存储和列存储的优点： 首先，RCFile保证同一行的数据位于同一节点，因此元组重构的开销很低； 其次，像列存储一样，RCFile能够利用列维度的数据压缩，并且能跳过不必要的列读取； 4、ORCFile 存储方式：数据按行分块每块按照列存储。 压缩快、快速列存取。 效率比rcfile高，是rcfile的改良版本。 小结： 相比TEXTFILE和SEQUENCEFILE，RCFILE由于列式存储方式，数据加载时性能消耗较大，但是具有较好的压缩比和查询响应。 数据仓库的特点是一次写入、多次读取，因此，整体来看，RCFILE相比其余两种格式具有较明显的优势。

在Spark中，最终Job3从逻辑上的计算过程是：Job3 = (Job1.map).filter，整个过程是共享内存的，而不需要中间结果存放在可靠的分布式文件系统中。 2 Resilient Distributed Datasets 分布式 RDD支持分区，可以运行在集群中 弹性 RDD支持高效的容错 RDD中的数据即可以缓存在内存中，也可以缓存在磁盘中，也可以缓存在外部存储中 数据集 RDD可以不保存具体数据，只保留创建自己的必备信息，例如依赖和计算函数 RDD也可以缓存起来，相当于存储具体数据 3 Feature RDD是数据集 RDD不仅是数据集，也是编程模型 RDD的算子大致分为两类： Transformation转化操作，例如：map、flatMap、filter等 Action动作操作，例如：reduce、collect、show等 RDD是编程模型 RDD相互之间有依赖关系 RDD是可以分区的 RDD是只读的 RDD需要容错，可以惰性求值，可以移动计算，所以很难支持修改，显著降低问题的复杂度。 sparkRdd 4 sparkContext SparkContext是spark功能的主要入口。其代表与spark集群的连接，能够用来在集群上创建RDD、累加器、广播变量。每个JVM里只能存在一个处于激活状态的SparkContext，在创建新的SparkContext之前必须调用stop()来关闭之前的SparkContext。 每一个Spark应用都是一个SparkContext实例，可以理解为一个SparkContext就是一个spark application的生命周期，一旦SparkContext创建之后，就可以用这个SparkContext来创建RDD、累加器、广播变量，并且可以通过SparkContext访问Spark的服务，运行任务。spark context设置内部服务，并建立与spark执行环境的连接。

解决的问题可以分解为多个可以并发计算的部分 每个部分可以在不同处理器上被同时执行 需要一个共享内存的机制 需要一个总体上的协作机制来进行调度 如果放在集群中，如何对整个计算任务进行分解？ sparkFile2Cluster2 概述 对于HDFS中的文件，是分为不同的Block 在进行计算的时候，就可以按照Block来划分，每一个Block对应一个不同的计算单元 扩展 RDD并没有真实的存放数据，数据是从HDFS中读取的，在计算的过程中读取即可 RDD至少是需要可以分片的，因为HDFS中的文件就是分片的，RDD可以分片也意味着可以并行计算 移动数据不如移动计算是一个基础的优化，如何做到？ 每一个计算单元需要记录其存储单元的位置，尽量调度过去 集群中运行，需要多节点配合，出错的概率也更高，出错了怎么办？ RDD1-\u003eRDD2-\u003eRDD3这个过程中，RDD2出错了，有两种解决办法 缓存RDD2的数据，直接恢复RDD2，类似HDFS的备份机制 记录RDD2的依赖关系，通过其父级的RDD来恢复RDD2，这种方式会少很多数据的交互和保存 如何通过父级RDD恢复？ 记录RDD2的父亲是RDD1 记录RDD2的计算函数，例如RDD2 = RDD1.map(…)等计算函数 通过父级RDD和计算函数来恢复RDD2 任务特别复杂，流程特别长，有很多RDD之间有依赖关系，如何优化？ 上面提到了可以使用依赖关系来进行容错，但是如果依赖关系特别长的时候，这种方式其实也比较低效，这个时候就应该使用另外一种方式，也就是记录数据集的状态 在Spark中有两个手段可以做到 缓存 Checkpoint map() \u0026 mapPartitions() mapPartitions 和 map 算子是一样的，只不过map是针对每一条数据进行转换，mapPartitions针对一整个分区的数据进行转换 所以 map 的 func 参数是单条数据，mapPartitions 的 func 参数是一个集合(一个分区整个所有的数据) map 的 func 返回值也是单条数据，mapPartition 的 func 返回值是一个集合 mapPartitionWithIndex 和 mapPartition 的区别是 func 中多分区数量参数 filter() 保留满足条件的元素 sample() filter按照规律过滤，sample则是随机采样 def sample( withReplacement: Boolean, //是否重复取样 fraction: Double, //取样比例 seed: Long = Utils.random.nextLong): RDD[T] = {...} mapValues() mapValue也是map，map作用于全部数据，mapValue作用于value collection operation 交集：rdd1.intersection(rdd2) 并集：rdd1.union(rdd2) 差集：rdd1.subract(rdd2) groupByKey() 聚合操作： reduceByKey -\u003e按照key分组，然后把每一组数据reduce。reduceByKey在map端combiner能减少IO，一个分区放多个数据。 groupByKey 运算结果的格式：（k，（value1，value2）），没有减少IO sc.parallelize(Seq((\"a\",1),(\"a\",1),(\"b\",1))) .groupByKey() .collect() .foreach(println(_)) combineByKey() 接收三个参数： 转化数据的函数（初始函数，作用于第一条数据，用于开启整个计算） 在分区上进行聚合 把所有的分区的聚合结果聚合为最终结果 val result = rdd.combineBykey( createCombiner = curr =\u003e (curr,1), mergeValue = (curr: (Double, Int), nextValue: Double) =\u003e (curr._1 + nextValue, curr._2 + 1)), mergeCombiners = (curr: (Double,Int), agg: (Double, Int)) =\u003e (curr._1 + agg._1, curr._2 + agg._2) ) result.map(item =\u003e (item._1, item._2._1 / item._2._2)) foldByKey() 功能等同于reduceByKey()，增加了初始值。reduceByKey底层是combineByKey()，foldByKey()底层是aggregateByKey()。 aggregateByKey() join() 按照相同的Key进行连接 sortBy() 排序：sortBy()，sortByKey() coalesce() 一般涉及到分区操作的算子常见的有两个，repartition和coalesce，都可以调大或者调小分区数量 summary 所有的转化操作的算子都是惰性的，在执行时候不会调度运行求得结果，而只是生成了对应的RDD 只有在Action操作的时候，才会真的运行

Spark支持宽依赖的转换，例如groupByKey和reduceByKey。在这些依赖项中，计算单个分区中的记录所需的数据可以来自于父数据集的许多分区中。要执行这些转换，具有相同key的所有元组必须最终位于同一分区中，由同一任务处理。为了满足这一要求，Spark产生一个shuffle，它在集群内部传输数据，并产生一个带有一组新分区的新stage。 Hash base shuffle Reduce 找到每个Mapper中对应自己哈希桶拉取数据 缺点：过多占用资源占用 Sort base shuffle 先按照partition ID 排序， 后按照Key的HashCode排序 partition and shuffle relation 分区主要用来实现并行计算，和shuffle没什么关系，但数据处理时，例如reduceByKey，groupByKey等聚合操作，需要把Key相同的Value拉取到一起进行计算，这个时候因为这些Key的相同的Value可能会在不同的分区，所以理解分区才能理解shuffle的根本原理 shuffle feature 只有KV型的RDD才会有Shuffle操作 早期版本spark的shuffle算法是

HDFS的NameNode中主要职责就是维护两个文件，一个是edits，另一个是fsimage。 edits中主要存放Editlog，FsImage保存了当前系统中所有目录和文件的信息，这个FsImage其实就是一个Checkpoint。 每一次修改文件的时候，都会在Edits中添加一条记录。 在一定条件满足的情况下，把edits删掉添加一个新的FSimage，包含了系统当前最新的状态。好处：增加速度，提高稳定性 Checkpoint和Cache的区别： Cache可以吧RDD计算出来放到内存中，但RDD的依赖链(相当于NameNode中的Edits日志)是不能丢的，若出现错误，只能重计算出来。 Checkpoint把结果存放在HDFS这类存储中，就变成了可靠的数据，如果出错了，则通过复制HDFS中的文件来实现容错。 如何使用： 两步： val conf = new.SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[6]\").setAppName(\"debug_string\") //1. setCheckPointDir：设置保存目录，也可以设置为HDFS上的目录

当触发Action执行的时候，这一组互相依赖的RDD要被处理，所以要转化为可运行的物理执行图，调度到集群中执行。 因为大部分RDD是不真正存放数据的，只是数据从中流转，所以不能直接在集群中运行RDD，要有一种pipeline的思想，需要将这组RDD转为Stage和Task，从而运行Task，优化整体执行速度。 RDDphysic 小结： ① -\u003e ① -\u003e ① 在第一个stage中，每一个这样的执行流程是一个Task，也就是在同一个Stage中的所有RDD的对应分区，在同一个Task中执行 Stage的划分是由Shuffle操作来确定的，有Shuffle的地方，Stage断开 数据流动 val sc = ... val textRDD = sc.parallelize(Seq(\"Hadoop Spark\", \"Hadoop Flume\",

如果遇到宽依赖的话，两个RDD之间需要进行数据拉取和复制 那么一个RDD就必须等待它所依赖的RDD所有分区先计算完成，然后再进行拉取 所以，一个Job是无法计算完整的RDD血统的 ​ Stage和Task的关系 Stage中的RDD之间是窄依赖： 窄依赖RDD理论上可以放在同一个Pipeline中执行的 RDD还有分区： 一个RDD只是一个概念，而真正存放和处理数据时，都是以分区作为单位的 Stage对应的是多个整体上的RDD，而真正的运行是需要针对RDD的分区来进行的 一个Task对应一个RDD的分区： 一个比Stage粒度更细的单元叫做Task，Stage是由Task组成的，之所以有Task这个概念，是因为Stage针对整个RDD，而计算的时候，要针对RDD的分区。 总结： Job\u003eStage\u003eTask 一个Job由多个Stage组成(这个取决有多少个宽依赖)，一个Stage由多个Task组成（这个取决有多少个分区数量 而Stage中经常会有一组Task需要同时执行，所以针对每一个Task来进行调度太过频繁没有意义，所以每个Stage中的Task们会被收集起来，放入一个TaskSet集合中。 一个Stage有一个TaskSet TaskSet中Task的个数由Stage中的最大分区数决定

部署在网络提供商的机房，当用户来访问的时候，从距离用户最近的服务器返回数据，尽快呈现给用户；通常情况下在CDN中缓存的是静态资源（html,js,css），达到动静分离；但是有时候遇到了某些数据访问量特别大的时候，后端会生成静态资源放入到CDN，比如：商城的首页，每个用户进入都需要访问的页面，如果每次请求都进入到后端，那么服务器的压力肯定不小，这种情况下会把首页生成静态的文件缓存到cdn和反向代理服务器 反向代理：部署在应用的中心机房，通常也是缓存的静态资源，当用户通过CDN未请求到需要的数据时，先进入反向代理服务器，如果有缓存用户访问的数据，那么直接返回给用户；这里也有特殊情况，对于有些场景下的热点数据，在这里根据用户的请求去分布式缓存服务器中获取，能拿到就直接返回。 这种架构已经把缓存做到了4级 第一级：CDN 缓存静态资源 第二级：反向代理缓存静态资源以及部分热点数据

Why 为什么使用消息队列？ 从系统之间有通信需求开始，就自然产生了消息队列。 在计算机科学中，消息队列（英语：Message queue）是一种进程间通信或同一进程的不同线程间的通信方式，软件的贮列用来处理一系列的输入，通常是来自用户。消息队列提供了异步的通信协议，每一个贮列中的纪录包含详细说明的资料，包含发生的时间，输入设备的种类，以及特定的输入参数，也就是说：消息的发送者和接收者不需要同时与消息队列交互。消息会保存在队列中，直到接收者取回它。 ","date":"2020-04-27","objectID":"/20200427_kafka/:1:1","tags":["Kafka","Distribution"],"title":"Kafka: A Stream Processing Platform for Distributed Applications","uri":"/20200427_kafka/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"2. Feature 解耦： 允许你独立的扩展或修改两边的处理过程，只要确保它们遵守同样的接口约束。 冗余： 消息队列把数据进行持久化直到它们已经被完全处理，通过这一方式规避了数据丢失风险。许多消息队列所采用的”插入-获取-删除”范式中，在把一个消息从队列中删除之前，需要你的处理系统明确的指出该消息已经被处理完毕，从而确保你的数据被安全的保存直到你使用完毕。 扩展性： 因为消息队列解耦了你的处理过程，所以增大消息入队和处理的频率是很容易的，只要另外增加处理过程即可。 灵活性 \u0026 峰值处理能力： 在访问量剧增的情况下，应用仍然需要继续发挥作用，但是这样的突发流量并不常见。如果为以能处理这类峰值访问为标准来投入资源随时待命无疑是巨大的浪费。使用消息队列能够使关键组件顶住突发的访问压力，而不会因为突发的超负荷的请求而完全崩溃。 可恢复性： 系统的一部分组件失效时，不会影响到整个系统。消息队列降低了进程间的耦合度，所以即使一个处理消息的进程挂掉，加入队列中的消息仍然可以在系统恢复后被处理。 顺序保证： 在大多使用场景下，数据处理的顺序都很重要。大部分消息队列本来就是排序的，并且能保证数据会按照特定的顺序来处理。（Kafka 保证一个 Partition 内的消息的有序性） 缓冲： 有助于控制和优化数据流经过系统的速度，解决生产消息和消费消息的处理速度不一致的情况。 异步通信： 很多时候，用户不想也不需要立即处理消息。消息队列提供了异步处理机制，允许用户把一个消息放入队列，但并不立即处理它。想向队列中放入多少消息就放多少，然后在需要的时候再去处理它们。 ","date":"2020-04-27","objectID":"/20200427_kafka/:1:2","tags":["Kafka","Distribution"],"title":"Kafka: A Stream Processing Platform for Distributed Applications","uri":"/20200427_kafka/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"3. Usage 服务解耦： 下游系统可能只需要当前系统的一个子集，应对不断增加变化的下游系统，当前系统不停地修改调试与这些下游系统的接口，系统间耦合过于紧密。引入消息队列后，当前系统变化时发送一条消息到消息队列的一个主题中，所有下游系统都订阅主题，这样每个下游系统都可以获得一份实时完整的订单数据。 异步处理： 以秒杀为例：风险控制-\u003e库存锁定-\u003e生成订单-\u003e短信通知-\u003e更新统计数据 限流削峰/流量控制 一个设计健壮的程序有自我保护的能力，也就是说，它应该可以在海量的请求下，还能在自身能力范围内尽可能多地处理请求，拒绝处理不了的请求并且保证自身运行正常。使用消息队列隔离网关和后端服务，以达到流量控制和保护后端服务的目的。 ","date":"2020-04-27","objectID":"/20200427_kafka/:1:3","tags":["Kafka","Distribution"],"title":"Kafka: A Stream Processing Platform for Distributed Applications","uri":"/20200427_kafka/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"4.

History Kafka从何而来?我们为什么要开发Kafka? Kafka到底是什么? Kafka 最初是 LinkedIn 的一个内部基础设施系统。我们发现虽然有很多数据库和系统可以用来存储数据，但在我们的架构里，刚好缺一个可以帮助处理持续数据流的组件。在开发Kafka之前，我们实验了各种现成的解决方案，从消息系统到日志聚合系统，再到ETL工具，它们都无法满足我们的需求。 最后，我们决定从头开发一个系统。我们不想只是开发一个能够存储数据的系统，比如传统的关系型数据库、键值存储引擎、搜索引擎或缓存系统，我们希望能够把数据看成是持续变化和不断增长的流，并基于这样的想法构建出一个数据系统。事实上，是一个数据架构。 这个想法实现后比我们最初预想的适用性更广。Kafka 一开始被用在社交网络的实时应用和数据流当中，而现在已经成为下一代数据架构的基础。大型零售商正在基于持续数据流改造他们的基础业务流程，汽车公司正在从互联网汽车那里收集和处理实时数据流，银行也在重新思考基于 Kafka 改造他们的基础。 它可以用于两大类别的应用: 构造实时流数据管道，它可以在系统或应用之间可靠地获取数据。(相当于message queue) 构建实时流式应用程序，对这些流数据进行转换或者影响。(就是流处理，通过kafka stream topic和topic之间内部进行变化) 版本号 备注 0.7 上古版本，提供了最基础的消息队列功能 0.8 引入了副本机制，成为了一个真正意义上完备的分布式高可靠消息队列解决方案 0.8.2 新版本 Producer API，即需要指定 Broker 地址的 Producer 0.9 增加了基础的安全认证 / 权限，Java 重写了新版本消费者 API 0.10.0.0 引入了 Kafka Streams 0.11.0.0 提供幂等性 Producer API 以及事务（Transaction） API，对 Kafka 消息格式做了重构。 1.0 Kafka Streams 的各种改进 2.0 Kafka Streams 的各种改进 ","date":"2020-04-27","objectID":"/20200427_kafka/:2:2","tags":["Kafka","Distribution"],"title":"Kafka: A Stream Processing Platform for Distributed Applications","uri":"/20200427_kafka/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"3.

Topic 日志 日志可能是一种最简单的不能再简单的存储抽象，只能追加、按照时间完全有序（totally-ordered）的记录序列。日志看起来的样子： kafkaLog 在日志的末尾添加记录，读取日志记录则从左到右。每一条记录都指定了一个唯一的顺序的日志记录编号。 日志记录的次序（ordering）定义了『时间』概念，因为位于左边的日志记录表示比右边的要早。日志记录编号可以看作是这条日志记录的『时间戳』。把次序直接看成是时间概念，刚开始你会觉得有点怪异，但是这样的做法有个便利的性质：解耦了 时间 和 任一特定的物理时钟（physical clock）。引入分布式系统后，这会成为一个必不可少的性质。 日志 和 文件或数据表（table）并没有什么大的不同。文件是一系列字节，表是由一系列记录组成，而日志实际上只是一种按照时间顺序存储记录的数据表或文件。 对于每一个topic， Kafka集群都会维持一个分区日志，如下所示： kafkaPartitionLog 实操 启动zk cd /usr/local/kara/kafka_2.13-2.6.0/bin zookeeper-server-start.sh ../config/zookeeper.properties 启动kafka服务器 kafka-server-start.sh ../config/server.properties 创建topic，4个分区，一个副本 kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4 --topic partition_test 发送一些消息 kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic partition_test 启动一个consumer kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic partition_test --from-beginning 分区 partition存储分布 一个topic下有多个不同partition，每个partition为一个目录，partiton命名规则为topic名称+有序序号，第一个partiton序号从0开始，序号最大值为partitions数量减1 partition文件存储 1.每个partion(目录)相当于一个巨型文件被平均分配到多个大小相等segment(段)数据文件中。但每个段segment file消息数量不一定相等，这种特性方便old segment file快速被删除。 2.每个partiton只需要支持顺序读写就行了，segment文件生命周期由服务端配置参数决定。 segment文件存储 segment file组成：由2大部分组成，分别为index file和data file，此2个文件一一对应，成对出现，分别表示为segment索引文件、数据文件. segment文件命名规则：partion全局的第一个segment从0开始，后续每个segment文件名为上一个segment文件最后一条消息的offset值。数值最大为64位long大小，19位数字字符长度，没有数字用0填充。segment index file采取稀疏索引存储方式，它减少索引文件大小，通过mmap可以直接内存操作，稀疏索引为数据文件的每个对应message设置一个元数据指针,它比稠密索引节省了更多的存储空间，但查找起来需要消耗更多的时间。 segment中的消息message物理结构字段说明 关键字 解释说明 8 byte offset 在parition(分区)内的每条消息都有一个有序的id号，这个id号被称为偏移(offset),它可以唯一确定每条消息在parition(分区)内的位置。即offset表示partiion的第多少message 4 byte message size message大小 4 byte CRC32 用crc32校验message 1 byte “magic” 表示本次发布Kafka服务程序协议版本号 1 byte “attributes” 表示为独立版本、或标识压缩类型、或编码类型。 4 byte key length 表示key的长度,当key为-1时，K byte key字段不填 K byte key 可选 value bytes payload 表示实际消息数据。 文件系统 Kafka 对消息的存储和缓存严重依赖于文件系统。人们对于“磁盘速度慢”具有普遍印象，事实上，磁盘的速度比人们预期的要慢的多，也快得多，这取决于人们使用磁盘的方式。 使用6个7200rpm、SATA接口、RAID-5的磁盘阵列在JBOD配置下的顺序写入的性能约为600MB/秒，但随机写入的性能仅约为100k/秒，相差6000倍以上。 线性的读取和写入是磁盘使用模式中最有规律的，并且由操作系统进行了大量的优化。 read-ahead 是以大的 data block 为单位预先读取数据 write-behind 是将多个小型的逻辑写合并成一次大型的物理磁盘写入 关于该问题的进一步讨论可以参考 ACM Queue article，他们发现实际上顺序磁盘访问在某些情况下比随机内存访问还要快！ 为了弥补这种性能差异，现代操作系统主动将所有空闲内存用作 disk caching（磁盘高速缓存），所有对磁盘的读写操作都会通过这个统一的 cache（ in-process cache）。 即使进程维护了 in-process cache，该数据也可能会被复制到操作系统的 pagecache 中，事实上所有内容都被存储了两份。 此外，Kafka 建立在 JVM 之上，任何了解 Java 内存使用的人都知道两点： 对象的内存开销非常高，通常是所存储的数据的两倍(甚至更多)。 随着堆中数据的增加，Java 的垃圾回收变得越来越复杂和缓慢。 kafka选择了一个非常简单的设计：相比于维护尽可能多的 in-memory cache，并且在空间不足的时候匆忙将数据 flush 到文件系统，我们把这个过程倒过来。所有数据一开始就被写入到文件系统的持久化日志中，而不用在 cache 空间不足的时候 flush 到磁盘。实际上，这表明数据被转移到了内核的 pagecache 中。 Pagecache页面缓存 Page cache（页面缓存） Page cache 也叫页缓冲或文件缓冲，是由好几个磁盘块构成，大小通常为4k，在64位系统上为8k，构成的几个磁盘块在物理磁盘上不一定连续，文件的组织单位为一页， 也就是一个page cache大小，文件读取是由外存上不连续的几个磁盘块，到buffer cache，然后组成page cache，然后供给应用程序。 Buffer cache（块缓存） Buffer cache 也叫块缓冲，是对物理磁盘上的一个磁盘块进行的缓冲，其大小为通常为1k，磁盘块也是磁盘的组织单位。设立buffer cache的目的是为在程序多次访问同一磁盘块时，减少访问时间。 Page cache（页面缓存）与Buffer cache（块缓存）的区别 磁盘的操作有逻辑级（文件系统）和物理级（磁盘块），这两种Cache就是分别缓存逻辑和物理级数据的。 我们通过文件系统操作文件，那么文件将被缓存到Page Cache，如果需要刷新文件的时候，Page Cache将交给Buffer Cache去完成，因为Buffer Cache就是缓存磁盘块的。 简单说来，page cache用来缓存文件数据，buffer cache用来缓存磁盘数据。在有文件系统的情况下，对文件操作，那么数据会缓存到page cache，如果直接采用dd等工具对磁盘进行读写，那么数据会缓存到buffer cache。 Buffer(Buffer Cache)以块形式缓冲了块设备的操作，定时或手动的同步到硬盘，它是为了缓冲写操作然后一次性将很多改动写入硬盘，避免频繁写硬盘，提高写入效率。 Cache(Page Cache)以页面形式缓存了文件系统的文件，给需要使用的程序读取，它是为了给读操作提供缓冲，避免频繁读硬盘，提高读取效率。 降低时间复杂度 消息系统使用的持久化数据结构通常是和 BTree 相关联的消费者队列或者其他用于存储消息源数据的通用随机访问数据结构。BTree 的操作复杂度是 O(log N)，通常我们认为 O(log N) 基本等同于常数时间，但这条在磁盘操作中不成立。 存储系统将非常快的cache操作和非常慢的物理磁盘操作混合在一起，当数据随着 fixed cache 增加时，可以看到树的性能通常是非线性的——比如数据翻倍时性能下降不只两倍。 kafka选择把持久化队列建立在简单的读取和向文件后追加两种操作之上，这和日志解决方案相同。这种架构的优点在于所有的操作复杂度都是O(1)，而且读操作不会阻塞写操作，读操作之间也不会互相影响。 在不产生任何性能损失的情况下能够访问几乎无限的硬盘空间，Kafka 可以让消息保留相对较长的一段时间(比如一周)，而不是试图在被消费后立即删除。 降低大量小型IO操作的影响 小型的 I/O 操作发生在客户端和服务端之间以及服务端自身的持久化操作中。 为了避免这种情况，kafka的协议是建立在一个 “消息块” 的抽象基础上，合理将消息分组。将多个消息打包成一组，而不是每次发送一条消息，从而使整组消息分担网络中往返的开销。 这个简单的优化对速度有着数量级的提升。批处理允许更大的网络数据包，更大的顺序读写磁盘操作，连续的内存块等等，所有这些都使 KafKa 将随机流消息顺序写入到磁盘， 再由 consumers 进行消费。 零拷贝 字节拷贝是低效率的操作，在消息量少的时候没啥问题，但是在高负载的情况下，影响就不容忽视。为了避免这种情况，kafka使用 producer ，broker 和 consumer 都共享的标准化的二进制消息格式，这样数据块不用修改就能在他们之间传递。 保持这种通用格式可以对一些很重要的操作进行优化: 持久化日志块的网络传输。现代的unix 操作系统提供了一个高度优化的编码方式，用于将数据从 pagecache 转移到 socket 网络连接中；在 Linux 中系统调用 sendfile 做到这一点。 传统IO (4次上下文切换4次拷贝) 假如将磁盘上的文件读取出来，然后通过网络协议发送给客户端。 一般需要两个系统调用，但是一共4次上下文切换，4次拷贝 read(file, tmp_buf, len); write(socket, tmp_buf, len); 要想提高文件传输的性能，就需要减少「用户态与内核态的上下文切换」和「内存拷贝」的次数。 mmap(4次上下文切换3次拷贝) mmap()系统调用函数会直接把内核缓冲区里的数据「映射」到用户空间，这样，操作系统内核与用户空间就不需要再进行任何的数据拷贝操作，它替换了read()系统调用函数。 buf = mmap(file, len); write(sockfd, buf, len); sendfile（2次上下文切换3次拷贝） Linux 内核版本 2.1 中，提供了一个专门发送文件的系统调用函数 sendfile() 首先，它可以替代前面的 read()和 write()这两个系统调用，这样就可以减少一次系统调用，也就减少了 2 次上下文切换的开销。 其次，该系统调用，可以直接把内核缓冲区里的数据拷贝到 socket 缓冲区里，不再拷贝到用户态，这样就只有 2 次上下文切换，和 3 次数据拷贝。 #include \u003csys/socket.h\u003e ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count); 它的前两个参数分别是目的端和源端的文件描述符，后面两个参数是源端的偏移量和复制数据的长度，返回值是实际复制数据的长度。 零拷贝（2次上下文切换2次拷贝） Linux 内核 2.4 版本开始起，对于支持网卡支持 SG-DMA 技术的情况下， sendfile() 系统调用的过程发生了点变化，具体过程如下： 第一步，通过 DMA 将磁盘上的数据拷贝到内核缓冲区里； 第二步，缓冲区描述符和数据长度传到 socket 缓冲区，这样网卡的 SG-DMA 控制器就可以直接将内核缓存中的数据拷贝到网卡的缓冲区里，此过程不需要将数据从操作系统内核缓冲区拷贝到 socket 缓冲区中，这样就减少了一次数据拷贝； kafka高效文件存储设计特点 Kafka把topic中一个parition大文件分成多个小文件段，通过多个小文件段，就容易定期清除或删除已经消费完文件，减少磁盘占用。 通过索引信息可以快速定位message和确定response的最大大小。 通过index元数据全部映射到memory，可以避免segment file的IO磁盘操作。 通过索引文件稀疏存储，可以大幅降低index文件元数据占用空间大小。 ","date":"2020-04-27","objectID":"/20200427_kafka/:2:4","tags":["Kafka","Distribution"],"title":"Kafka: A Stream Processing Platform for Distributed Applications","uri":"/20200427_kafka/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"Article description.","date":"2020-03-26","objectID":"/20200326_hdfs-nfs/","tags":["Hdfs","NFS","Distribution"],"title":"HDFS NFS Gateway: Benefits, Configuration, and Usage","uri":"/20200326_hdfs-nfs/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"The major difference between the two is Replication/Fault Tolerance.

基于标记-清除（Mark-Sweep）算法，尽量减少停顿时间。 缺点： Incremental update天然bug，会有漏标的问题，所以CMS的remark阶段，必须重头扫描一遍，STW是所有时间最长的。存在碎片化问题，在长时间运行的情况下会发生full GC，导致恶劣停顿。会占用更多的CPU资源，和用户争抢线程。在JDK 9中被标记为废弃。 Parrallel GC（parallel

This is because of the padding added by the compiler to avoid alignment issues. Padding is only added when a structure member is followed by a member with a larger size or at the end of the structure. Different compilers might have different alignment constraints as C standards state that alignment of structure totally depends on the implementation. Case 1: struct A { // sizeof(int) = 4 int x; // Padding of 4 bytes // sizeof(double) = 8 double z; // sizeof(short int) = 2 short int y; // Padding of 6 bytes }; Output: ​ Size of struct: 24 struct_sizeof_ex1 The red portion represents the padding added for data alignment and the green portion represents the struct members.

No padding is needed at the end in this case for data alignment. C language doesn’t allow the compilers to reorder the struct members to reduce the amount of padding. In order to minimize the amount of padding, the struct members must be sorted in a descending order (similar to the case 2).

command.h cc -c files.c utils.o : utils.c defs.h cc -c utils.c clean : rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o 反斜杠（\\）是换行符的意思。这样比较便于Makefile的易读。 在这个makefile中，目标文件（target）包含：执行文件edit和中间目标文件（*.o），依赖文件（prerequisites）就是冒号后面的那些 .c 文件和 .h文件。每一个 .o 文件都有一组依赖文件，而这些 .o 文件又是执行文件 edit 的依赖文件。依赖关系的实质上就是说明了目标文件是由哪些文件生成的，换言之，目标文件是哪些文件更新的。 在定义好依赖关系后，后续的那一行定义了如何生成目标文件的操作系统命令，一定要以一个Tab键作为开头。记住，make并不管命令是怎么工作的，他只管执行所定义的命令。make会比较targets文件和prerequisites文件的修改日期，如果prerequisites文件的日期要比targets文件的日期要新，或者target不存在的话，那么，make就会执行后续定义的命令。

make是如何工作的 在默认的方式下，也就是我们只输入make命令。那么， make会在当前目录下找名字叫“Makefile”或“makefile”的文件。 如果找到，它会找文件中的第一个目标文件（target），在上面的例子中，他会找到“edit”这个文件，并把这个文件作为最终的目标文件。 如果edit文件不存在，或是edit所依赖的后面的 .o 文件的文件修改时间要比edit这个文件新，那么，他就会执行后面所定义的命令来生成edit这个文件。 如果edit所依赖的.o文件也存在，那么make会在当前文件中找目标为.o文件的依赖性，如果找到则再根据那一个规则生成.o文件。 当然，C文件和H文件是存在的啦，于是make会生成 .o 文件，然后再用 .o 文件声明make的终极任务，也就是执行文件edit了。 这就是整个make的依赖性，make会一层又一层地去找文件的依赖关系，直到最终编译出第一个目标文件。在找寻的过程中，如果出现错误，比如最后被依赖的文件找不到，那么make就会直接退出，并报错，而对于所定义的命令的错误，或是编译不成功，make根本不理。make只管文件的依赖性 于是在我们编程中，如果这个工程已被编译过了，当我们修改了其中一个源文件，比如file.c，那么根据我们的依赖性，我们的目标file.o会被重编译（也就是在这个依性关系后面所定义的命令），于是file.o的文件也是最新的啦，于是file.o的文件修改时间要比edit要新，所以edit也会被重新链接了（详见edit目标文件后定义的命令）。 而如果我们改变了“command.h”，那么，kdb.o、command.o和files.o都会被重编译，并且，edit会被重链接。 ","date":"2018-09-15","objectID":"/20180915_makefile-cmakelist/:2:3","tags":["C","C++"],"title":"Makefile

edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o 看到[.o]文件的字符串被重复了两次，如果我们的工程需要加入新的[.o]文件，那么需要在两个地方加。因为此时的makefile并不复杂。当makefile变得复杂我们就有可能忘掉某个地方，而导致编译失败。所以为了makefile的易维护，在makefile中可以使用变量。 比如我们声明一个变量，objects, OBJECTS,objs,OBJS,或OBJ，表示obj文件。在makefile一开始就定义 objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o 于是，就可以方便的在makefile中以\"$(objects)“的方式来使用这个变量了。改良后的makefile如下： objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\ insert.o search.o files.o utils.o edit : $(objects) cc -o edit $(objects) main.o : main.c defs.h cc -c main.c command.o : command.c defs.h command.h cc -c command.c

} } put函数还有一个重要的功能，当size大于listSize时要主动扩容，这个判定条件看似有些不合理，当size大于listSize的时候可能因为冲突的存在，数组并没有存满，这时候就扩容不是浪费存储空间吗？事实确实如此，但这其实是为了加快检索速度一种妥协的办法，上文提到过，当size大于listSize时一定会发生冲突，因为哈希函数为了不越界，都会将计算出的HashCode进行取余操作，这就导致HashCode的个数一共就listSize个，超过这个个数就一定会冲突，冲突的越多，检索速度就越向O(n)靠拢，为了保证索引速度消耗一定的空间还是比较划算的，扩容时直接将容量变为了当前的两倍，这是考虑到扩容时需要将所有重新计算所有元素的HashCode，较为消耗时间，所以应该尽量的减少扩容次数。 ","date":"2018-04-05","objectID":"/20180405_hashcode/:5:0","tags":["C","HashCode"],"title":"C language realize HashMap","uri":"/20180405_hashcode/"},{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"6. 其它函数 let defaultGet(HashMap hashMap, let key) { int index = hashMap-\u003ehashCode(hashMap, key);
