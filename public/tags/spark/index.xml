    <description><![CDATA[<p>Apache Parquet is designed for efficient as well as performant flat columnar storage format of data compared to row based files like CSV or TSV files. Parquet uses the record shredding and assembly algorithm which is superior to simple flattening of nested namespaces. Parquet is optimized to work with complex data in bulk and features different ways for efficient data compression and encoding types. This approach is best especially for those queries that need to read certain columns from a large table. Parquet can only read the needed columns therefore greatly minimizing the IO.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>YARN is a generic resource-management framework for distributed workloads; in other words, a cluster-level operating system. Although part of the Hadoop ecosystem, YARN can support a lot of varied compute-frameworks (such as Tez, and Spark) in addition to MapReduce.</p>]]></description>
