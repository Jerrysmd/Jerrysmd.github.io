    <description><![CDATA[<p>Apache Parquet is designed for efficient as well as performant flat columnar storage format of data compared to row based files like CSV or TSV files. Parquet uses the record shredding and assembly algorithm which is superior to simple flattening of nested namespaces. Parquet is optimized to work with complex data in bulk and features different ways for efficient data compression and encoding types. This approach is best especially for those queries that need to read certain columns from a large table. Parquet can only read the needed columns therefore greatly minimizing the IO.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>HBase is a high reliability, high performance, column-oriented, and scalable distributed database. However, the READ/write performance deteriorates when a large amount of concurrent data or existing data is generated. You can use the following methods to improve the HBase search speed.</p>]]></description>
