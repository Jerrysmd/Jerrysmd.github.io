## Basic Sense of Risks and Management
### What Is Risk?

+ **Possibility of the bad things that might happen:**
  + It exists everywhere and anytime,we will focus on the financial world.
  + But it is not always a bad thing
    + **Good risk**: Risks that have a **positive expected payoff** on a stand-alone basis.
    + **Bad risk**: Risks that can be **expected to destroy value** on a stand alone basis.
    + Banks and other financial institutions c**annot succeed without taking risks.**

### What Is Risk Management?

+ **Risk management**: how firms actively select the types and levels of risks that are appropriate for them to take.
+ **Risk management and risk taking aren't opposites, but two sides of the same coin.**
  + Together they drive all our modern economies.
  + It's all about making forward-looking choices about risk in relation to reward.

### Is Risk Management Useful?

+ **Challenges for risk management** 
  + Fail to prevent market disruptions or **accounting scandals**
  + **Derivative** markets make it easier to take on large amount of risk.
  + Sophisticated financial engineering leads to the violent implosion of-firms.
  + Only **transfer** risks to other firms
    + Risk management is a zero-sum game
  + Work to the short-term benefit.

### Risk Management Process

2. Analyze and measure risk

### Analyze and measure risk

+ Quantitative Risk Measures
  + VaR(Value at risk)
    + Developed by Dennis Weatherstone,CEO of J.P.Morgan
    + VaR uses the loss distribution associated with a position or portfolio to estimate losses at a given level of likelihood (or confidence).
      + E.g. a one day 99% confidence level VaR of USD 1 million
+ Qualitative Risk Measures
  + Scenario analysis
  + Stress testing
