Hosting these large JS files myself would significantly impact my bandwidth usage since my host charges based on traffic volume. Using a CDN helps solve this issue by distributing requests across its worldwide network of data centers. Not only does this improve access speeds by caching files closer to users, it also reduces my origin server load and bandwidth costs. With assets offloaded to the CDN, my website performance is optimized for a better user experience while keeping infrastructure expenses down. In summary, a CDN provides clear benefits in both performance and savings for serving the static files required by my application at global scale.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Year in Moments: 2023 Video Blog</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20231231_2023-summary-video/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 11:12:39 +0800</pubDate><author/><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20231231_2023-summary-video/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the year, I captured short video clips documenting my travels, adventures, and life events using my camera.

If you run <code>cat mydb.sqlite</code>, you&rsquo;ll see a bunch of gibberish that doesn&rsquo;t resemble structured data at all. If you want to track changes and updates to a database using Git, you won&rsquo;t be able to see full diffs by default.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Color Grading DJI D-Cinelike Footage in DaVinci Resolve</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20231102_davinci-color-grading/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 08:14:18 +0800</pubDate><author/><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20231102_davinci-color-grading/</guid><description>&lt;p>This blog post will focus on color grading in DaVinci Resolve.
