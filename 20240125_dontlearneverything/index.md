+ Don't Waste Your Time Learning Everything
+ Companies will only pay you for your strongest skills
+ Continue learning
  + Recognize your strengths and be proud of them

  - Use "Hello World" to understand new technologies
  - Learn what you need, no need to learn everything
+ Keep your finger on new tech, but you don't need to do in-depth learning for every technology
  + Use "Hello World" to understand new technologies
  + Future technologies may fail, you won't lose out from investing too much in them
  + And these attempts may help lay the foundation for understanding later successes
