This is because of the padding added by the compiler to avoid alignment issues. Padding is only added when a structure member is followed by a member with a larger size or at the end of the structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The descriptions of typedef</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190717_typedef/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2019 09:22:18 +0800</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190717_typedef/</guid><description>&lt;p>A typedef is a C keyword that defines a new name for a data type, including internal data types (int, char, etc.) and custom data types (struct, etc.). A typedef is itself a type of stored class keyword that cannot appear in the same expression as the keywords auto, extern, static, register, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conditional compilation directives</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190611_conditional-compilation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 10:42:49 +0800</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190611_conditional-compilation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Conditional compilation is static compilation of code based on the actual definition of macros (some kind of condition). Compilation conditions can be determined based on the value of an expression or whether a particular macro is defined. C language conditional compilation related precompilation instructions, including #define, #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #elif, #else, #endif, defined.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>C Project Performance Tuning</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190409_cperformance-optimization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2019 20:04:00 +0800</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20190409_cperformance-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Performance optimization methods and ideas for large C projects.

If you want to compile source code, lib is all you need. If you want dynamically connected programs to run, you need only a DLL. This article will more clearly understand the difference, generation, use of the two.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Advanced method of reading files</title><link>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20181220_read-binary-file/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 18:39:37 -0700</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://jerrysmd.github.io/20181220_read-binary-file/</guid><description>&lt;p>Read the binary file (any file will do; this article uses binary as an example) and read the entire contents of the binary file into a char* string.
