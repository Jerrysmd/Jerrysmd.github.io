            &lt;p&gt;In development, we just need to know that lib is needed at compile time and DLL is needed at run time. If you want to compile source code, lib is all you need. If you want dynamically connected programs to run, you need only a DLL. This article will more clearly understand the difference, generation, use of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Makefiles define a set of rules that specify which files need to be compiled first, which files need to be compiled later, which files need to be recompiled, and even more complex functional operations, because makefiles are like Shell scripts that also execute operating system commands. One of the benefits of Makefiles is that they are &amp;quot;automatically compiled&amp;quot;. The entire project is automatically compiled, greatly improving the efficiency of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hyperscan is a high-performance regular expression matching library from Intel. It is based on the X86 platform based on PCRE prototype development. While supporting most of the syntax of PCRE, Hyperscan adds specific syntax and working modes to ensure its usefulness in real-world network scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
