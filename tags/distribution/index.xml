            &lt;p&gt;Apache Spark has its architectural foundation in the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD, followed by the Dataset API.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hive is a Hadoop-based data warehouse tool that maps structured data files into a database table and provides complete SQL query functionality that converts SQL statements into MapReduce tasks for execution. It is very suitable for statistical analysis of data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The features of large applications: high availability, high concurrency and big data. High availability: system need to provide service without interruption. High concurrency: still stable under the big access. Big data: store and manage big data well.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper is an open source distributed coordination framework. It is positioned to provide consistent services for distributed applications and is the administrator of the entire big data system. ZooKeeper will encapsulate key services that are complex and error-prone, and provide users with efficient, stable, and easy-to-use services.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KAFKA和消息队列: Kafka &amp; Message Queue</title>
      <link>https://Jerrysmd.github.io/post/20200427kafka/kafka/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;Apache Kafka aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library. Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a &amp;quot;message set&amp;quot; abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip. This &amp;quot;leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks [...] which allows Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HDFS &amp; NFS</title>
      <link>https://Jerrysmd.github.io/post/20200326hdfsnfs/hdfsnfs/</link>

            &lt;p&gt;The major difference between the two is Replication/Fault Tolerance. HDFS was designed to survive failures. NFS does not have any fault tolerance built in. Other than fault tolerance, HDFS does support multiple replicas of files. This eliminates (or eases) the common bottleneck of many clients accessing a single file. Since files have multiple replicas, on different physical disks, reading performance scales better than NFS.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala&#39;s static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
