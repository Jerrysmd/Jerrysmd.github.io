## Key Concepts

### Interest Rates

+ **Required rate of return**

  + Required rate of return / 要求回报率 / yield
  + Affected by the `supply and demand of funds` in the market
  + The return that investors and savers require to get them to willingly lend their funds
  + Usually for particular investment

  + Situation: If my money will save in one bank, what is the interest rates?
    + In this situation:
    + Interest rates = Required rate of return = Real Risk-free Return(真实无风险收益率) + Inflation rate(通货膨胀收益率)
  + Decompose required rate of return:
    + Nominal risk-free = real risk-free rate + expected inflation rate
    + Required interest rate on a security = nominal risk-free rate + default risk premium + liquidity risk premium + maturity risk premium

+ **Discount rate**

  + Discount rate / 折现率
  + The interest rate we use to `discount payments` to be made in the future
  + Usually used interchangeable with the interest rate
  + In different situation, we have different name for Interest rates：
    + Situation1: 100$ save in bank for one year, we got 10% interest rates, after one year I got 110$. 
    + In this situation, 10% interest rates called 10% Required rate of return
    + Situation2: I want to got 10$ after one year, the interest rates is 10%, how much shoud I save in bank? (x+10)/(1+10%) = x, x = 100
    + In this situation, 10% interest rates called 10% Discount rate

+ **Opportunity cost**

  + Opportunity cost / 机会成本
  + Also understood as a form of interest rate. It is the value that investors forgo by choosing a particular course of action
